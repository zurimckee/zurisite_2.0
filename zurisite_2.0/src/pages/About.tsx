                hey im zuri! right now, i happen to be super into web dev and have also been trying to make a project portfolio to show off my works,
                so i guess that's what this is supposed to be. i'm really into learning, creating, and exploring, and i think that this site 
                is a good way to do all three. this site is supposed to serve as a hub for all of my projects, coding and otherwise. 
                i hope you enjoy your time here!
            </p>
